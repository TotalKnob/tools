# Tools
This repo contains tools and scripts that I find nice to have on standby. Install all dependencies from 'installDependencies' for all tools to function.

## Root
* **dropCache** - Drops non-essential cache from memory, freeing up memory.
* **unswapPages** - Cycles swap to empty the whole swap.

## Non-root
* **toClipboard** - Copies all input to the clipboard.
